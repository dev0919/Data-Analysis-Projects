# 📊 Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

This repository presents a complete end-to-end **Data Warehousing and Analytics** solution. Designed as a portfolio project, it replicates real-world data engineering and analysis practices using the **Medallion Architecture** and **SQL Server**. The goal is to extract valuable business insights from ERP and CRM datasets using robust ETL pipelines, data modeling, and reporting.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture: Medallion Approach
![Data Architecture Diagram](docs/data_architecture.jpg)

We use the **Medallion Architecture** to structure the data warehouse in three layers:

### 🔹 Bronze Layer  
- Raw data ingestion from CSV files  
- Stored in SQL Server as-is from **ERP** and **CRM** sources  

### 🔸 Silver Layer  
- Data cleansing, deduplication, standardization, and transformation  
- Prepares data for efficient querying and analysis  

### 🥇 Gold Layer  
- Final analytical layer with **star schema** design  
- Fact and dimension tables optimized for BI and SQL-based reporting

## 📖 Project Overview

### ✅ What’s Covered

1. **Data Architecture** – Modern DW design using the Medallion model  
2. **ETL Pipelines** – Extraction from CSVs, transformation logic, and loading into SQL tables  
3. **Data Modeling** – Creation of fact and dimension tables  
4. **Analytics & Reporting** – SQL queries and dashboards to extract key business insights
